## SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
* STM32 IDE 
## COMPONENTS 
* STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER BOARD
## REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROJECTS ARE :
## DESCRIPTION
# STM32F407VG
* STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx are based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at 168 MHz. Cortex-M4 cores feature a floating point unit (FPU) that supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions. In addition, it implements a complete set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) to enhance application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded.
# Xpack Packages :
* Windows Build Tools:
The xPack Windows Build Tools is a standalone Windows binary distribution of GNU make and a few of other tools required by the Eclipse Embedded CDT (formerly GNU MCU/ARM Eclipse) project, but the binaries can also be used in generic build environments.
# OpenOCD :
* Open On-Chip Debugger (OpenOCD) is a free, open-source project that aims to provide debugging, in-system programming, and boundary scan using a debug adapter. The adapter is a hardware module that provides the right signals for the target to understand.
# QEMU :
* The xPack QEMU Arm is a standalone cross-platform binary distribution of QEMU, with several extensions for Arm Cortex-M devices.
# FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
 * Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
 * Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
 * 512 bytes of OTP memory.
 * Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.
# WORKING PRINCIPLE
 * Consider the automobile as a microcontroller. If the button is pressed, the first led (red) will turn on, clicking again will start the wiper, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired time. When the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper speed will increase as compared to the previous one. When the fourth button is pressed, the fourth led (orange) will be lit, and the wiper speed will increase in accordance with the previous one. After the fifth click, the microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off.

# USES

# 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW)
# WHAT
The operational speed of a vehicle wiper is controlled by a wiper speed control mechanism based on rain conditions. To generate, the control system incorporates a rain sensor (30) that detects rain conditions. The amplitude of an analogue signal depends on the detected rain conditions.
# WHY
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times.
#WHEN
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.
# WHO
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.
# HOW
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall
# WHERE
* In general, car wipers are controlled by the stalk on the right side of the steering wheel.
