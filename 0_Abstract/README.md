## Abstract
We demonstrate an automobile wiper control system using the STM32F4xx-discovery board in this project. In most automobiles, wipers are controlled by a DC motor, but since the STM32F4xx-discovery lacks a motor, we are considering using LEDs instead. For example, the wiper control system. Four LEDs and a push button are on the STM32F4xx-discovery board. LEDs come in orange, green, red, and blue colors. On the Discovery board, four user LEDs are connected to the PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 pins of PORTD using a current-limiting resistor. In order for a push button to work with the STM32F407VG microcontroller, the GPIO pins must be set as digital inputs. By pressing and holding the user button for two seconds, the Red When the ignition key is positioned at the ACC, the LED illuminates. Furthermore, the LEDs are flickering, which indicates that the wipers are on.
Windshield wipers are necessary to remove raindrops or other liquids from the windshield of a vehicle. Previously, the wiper had to be manually activated, and the operation of bringing up the wiper was difficult. Thus, the method proposed here is designed to solve these problems. By automating transmission, this project aims to improve the ageing automobiles' systems.
Wiping system, adding a sensor and an actuator to the system, and creating a simple program that would work with the system. This wiper system's principle is comparable to those of existing conventional wipers.
